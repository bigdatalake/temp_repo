Scenario Kafka consumer deliveries json event files(size in kbs) to S3 bucket in real time and want this data cataloged in Glue Catalog.

1. How and What will be the S3 partition startagey will you design for better storage and performance. Like year/month/day/hour or year_month_day/hour or year_month_day_hour
2. How do you orchestrate Glue crawler to crawl for only event event files to catalog ? like s3 event notification with sqs or event bridge

3. How can we leverage Iceberg tables for the above catalog ?
4. How do you handle the compaction of data.

5. email alerts only if pyspark job fails on emr  + orchestrate Airflow


Hive (metastore tables) --> No built-in ACID transaction support (traditional Hive)
"transactional table formats" or "lakehouse table formats" ---> iceberg tables -> Support atomic operations and ACID transactions




s3://bucket/data/{event_type}/year={YYYY}/month={MM}/day={DD}/hour={HH}/


Option 0: S3 Event Notifications -> SQS -> Glue Crawler
Option 1: S3 Event Notifications -> Lambda -> Glue Crawler
Option 2: S3 Event Notifications -> EventBridge -> Glue Crawler


Option 1: S3 Event Notifications + Lambda + Glue Crawler

	-> Configure S3 to send notifications to Lambda when new objects arrive
	-> Lambda accumulates events for a short period (e.g., 5-15 minutes)
	-> Lambda triggers Glue Crawler targeting only new partitions
	-> Set crawler to respect existing schema to avoid unnecessary metadata updates


CREATE TABLE catalog_name.db_name.table_name (
  -- schema definition
)
PARTITIONED BY (year, month, day, hour)
LOCATION 's3://bucket/data/event_type/'
TBLPROPERTIES (
  'table_type'='ICEBERG',
  'format'='parquet'
)

you don't actually need to run a Glue Crawler for Iceberg tables. This is one of Iceberg's key advantages.
Apache Iceberg handles metadata management automatically, making Glue Crawlers unnecessary for these tables. 




DAG modify --> sns topic -> subscribe to email	[ custom message with task details] [if the Airflow Scheduler crash, then this is a disadvantage ]
Cloud watch alaram [ may delays in detecting failures based on the cloudwatch polling]
