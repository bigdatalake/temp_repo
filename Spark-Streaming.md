‚úÖ `.outputMode("append")` is a **write strategy** in **Spark Structured Streaming** that controls **what data gets written to your sink (like console, file, database)** on each streaming micro-batch.

---

### ‚úÖ **What append mode means:**

* **"append"** means:
  ‚û°Ô∏è Spark will **only output new rows** **added since the last trigger** (i.e., strictly new incoming Kafka messages).
* ‚úÖ Suitable for **event streams like Kafka**, where data keeps flowing in **continuously**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Other Output Modes (for comparison):**

| Output Mode  | Meaning                                                                                | Typical Use Case                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **append**   | Only **new rows** are written out. Cannot see updates, only new incoming data.         | **Kafka, log ingestion, streaming appends**  |
| **update**   | Only **changed rows** (updated or added since last trigger) are output.                | **Aggregations with running counts/sums**    |
| **complete** | The **entire result table** (including old and new rows) is written every micro-batch. | **Full table aggregates like count of keys** |

---

With `.outputMode("append")`, Spark writes each new **event** as it comes, without re-processing older data.

---

### üìù **When to Use append Mode**

‚úÖ Use **append** if:

* You are **reading from Kafka** (or any unbounded source),
* Doing **stateless transformations** (e.g., select, map, filter),
* Sink supports it (e.g., **console**, **files**, **databases**).

‚ùó You **cannot use append mode** when performing **aggregations without watermarking**, because Spark needs to keep state.

| Option                         | Behavior                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `startingOffsets = "earliest"` | Spark reads **all available data** from the earliest offset (from the very first message in the topic). |
| `startingOffsets = "latest"`   | Spark reads **only new data** arriving after the stream starts, ignoring historical messages.           |

---

### üìå **Use Cases**:

* **"earliest"**: Useful when you want to **replay the full history** of a Kafka topic (e.g., for testing or backfilling).
* **"latest"**: Useful when you **only care about real-time streaming** without consuming past messages.

---

### üìù **Example Scenario:**

| Scenario                                      | Recommended Starting Offset |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Testing/debugging (want to see past messages) | `"earliest"`                |
| Real-time dashboard (only new data matters)   | `"latest"`                  |

---

### ‚úÖ **Summary in Simple Words**:

* `"earliest"` = **Read everything from the start**
* `"latest"` = **Start fresh from now**

---

In production, we can also use **offset checkpoints** to avoid resetting on restarts. 


---
‚úÖ **Checkpointing offsets** in Spark Structured Streaming is how you make your stream **fault-tolerant**‚Äîit keeps track of what Kafka messages have already been processed, so if your job restarts, it **resumes from the last processed offset**, not from `earliest` or `latest`.

---

## ‚úÖ **How Checkpointing Works in Spark**

* Spark writes **checkpoint data** (offsets and streaming progress metadata) to a **checkpoint directory** (usually on disk or cloud storage).
* When you **restart** the stream, Spark automatically reads these offsets and **continues from where it left off**.

---

### üìù **Sample Scala Code with Checkpointing**

```scala
val query = outputDf.writeStream
  .format("console")
  .option("checkpointLocation", "/tmp/spark-checkpoints/kafka-streaming") // üëà checkpoint dir
  .start()

query.awaitTermination()
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Effect on `startingOffsets`**:

| First Run     | Uses `startingOffsets` ("earliest" or "latest")             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Restarted Run | **Ignores startingOffsets** and **resumes from checkpoint** |

---

### üö® **Important Notes**:

* **Checkpoint location must be persistent** ‚Äî e.g., **S3**, **HDFS**, or **/tmp** (for local testing).
* **If checkpoint directory is deleted**, Spark **starts fresh** and will again respect `startingOffsets`.
* **Each streaming query needs a unique checkpoint location**, otherwise it can corrupt the state.

---

### ‚úÖ **Summary Table**:

| Concept            | Behavior                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| startingOffsets    | Determines initial starting point **only for the first execution** |
| checkpointLocation | Controls **where to resume after a restart**                       |
| Clean restart      | Delete checkpoint directory to restart from `startingOffsets`      |

###  
### REad from a specific timestamp

‚úÖ **Short Answer:**
Yes, **you can read Kafka data after a specific timestamp**, **but not directly through Spark Structured Streaming** options like `.option("startingOffsets", "...")`. Instead, you need to **programmatically fetch offsets based on a timestamp**, then start your stream from those offsets.

---

### ‚úÖ **How It Works Conceptually**

* Kafka **stores offsets**, and you can **query Kafka for offsets based on timestamp** using **Kafka APIs**.
* Spark Structured Streaming **requires offsets** (not timestamps), so you'd need to:

  1. Use Kafka APIs (outside Spark) to get offsets for your timestamp.
  2. Use **assign + startingOffsets** in Spark to start from those offsets.

---

### ‚úÖ **High-Level Example:**

#### 1. **Get Offsets for Timestamp (Python Example):**

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer, TopicPartition

consumer = KafkaConsumer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
topic = 'test_topic'
partition = 0
tp = TopicPartition(topic, partition)
consumer.assign([tp])

# Example timestamp in milliseconds since epoch
timestamp = 1720723200000  # Replace with your timestamp

offsets = consumer.offsets_for_times({tp: timestamp})
offset = offsets[tp].offset
print(f"Offset after timestamp is {offset}")
```

---

#### 2. **Pass Offsets to Spark:**

```python
spark.readStream \
  .format("kafka") \
  .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092") \
  .option("assign", '{"test_topic":[0]}') \
  .option("startingOffsets", f'{{"test_topic":{{"0":{offset}}}}}') \
  .load()
```

In Scala, you'd use the **same principle**: first calculate offsets, then configure `.option("startingOffsets", "...")`.

---

### üìù **Important Notes**:

* This works best if your **Kafka retention period** hasn‚Äôt expired (older messages will be deleted).
* This approach **requires knowing partition numbers**.
* Spark **does not natively allow startingOffsets by timestamp**, but **Kafka does** via its APIs.

---

### ‚úÖ **Summary**:

| Goal                             | How to Achieve It                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Start consuming after timestamp  | ‚úÖ Use Kafka API ‚Üí get offsets ‚Üí use in Spark         |
| Direct timestamp option in Spark | ‚ùå Not supported                                      |
| Production best practice         | ‚úÖ Pre-compute offsets & use assign + startingOffsets |
